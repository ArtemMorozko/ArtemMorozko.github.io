            <a> Rust is a multiplayer survival video game developed by Facepunch Studios.
                Rust was first released in December 2013 to the Steam Early Access program.
                During this period of development, the gameplay was changed significantly.
                Dangerous wildlife replaced zombies as the primary environmental threat and several
                fundamental revisions to the crafting system were released, along with general
                improvements and feature additions. While in Early Access, Rust was ported to the
                Unity 5 game engine, providing substantial graphical changes. The game also introduced
                immutable, predetermined skin colour and biological sex tied to players' Steam account details.
                Despite being fully released, the game continues to receive updates. </a>

        <h1>The purpose of the Rust
        <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/252490/ss_0e646f1a70e5cb8eed00efef8adb9579d40d5b2e.jpg" class="pict1"> </h1>
        As a multiplayer-only video game, Rust pits players against each other in a harsh, open world environment
            with the sole goal of survival. Animals, such as wolves and bears, act as a looming threat, but the primary danger
            comes from other players. Most maps are procedurally generated, with the exception of some pre-built maps. 
            When beginning, a player only has a rock and a torch. The rock can cut down trees, break apart stones, and be used as a weapon.
            Cloth and food can be gathered by killing animals; mining provides stone, metal ore, and sulfur ore; and chopping down trees provides wood.
        <h2> what should people do to survive? 
        <img src="https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rust-is-leaving-early-access-next-month-after-four-years-in-development-1516659820579.jpg" class="pict2"></h2>
        the player must have a sufficient amount of all required materials, with advanced items needing more obscure components scattered around the map.
        There are limitations imposed on the amount of craftable items, with blueprints allowing the creation of more advanced items.
        The player must stay fed or they will die of starvation. There are other challenges the player must overcome during gameplay, such as drowning,
        hypothermia, and wildlife attacks—primarily bears and wolves. Also, specific locales around the map are radioactive.
        There are four levels of radiation: minor, low, medium, and high. The correct armour or clothing must be worn to enter these areas;
        failure to do so can result in death. Upon death, a screen with an option to respawn at a random location or at a sleeping bag or bed
        (placed prior to death) appears. Respawning resets the player's inventory to the basic rock and torch. Rust is sometimes played in a "clan".
        Clans usually create housing for their members, give items and supplies to each other and partake in organised raiding and looting.
        <h3> PvP
        <img src="https://elintransigente.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rust.jpg" class="pict3">
        </h3> Player vs player (PvP) combat is accomplished with bows, melee weapons and craftable guns. Bullets and other projectiles travel in a ballistic
        trajectory, rather than being hitscan. There are a number of different types of bullet for each gun, including high velocity and explosive,
        thus allowing for more diverse strategy. Hit tracking calculates damage; shots to the head are more damaging than shots to other parts of the
        body. The use of weapon attachments, such as holographic sights, provide an advantage over opponents.
